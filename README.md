# Sentiment Analysis
This project is focused towards the upcoming 2023 Nigerian Presidential Election. Therefore, it is tailored to account for the four major candidates. Since twitter is one of the platforms most Nigerians use to voice their concerns and opinions, I pulled the data used in this project from twitter using the Twitter API. The aim of this project is to analyze the change in the public's sentiment around each candidate over time. I started running this project a few weeks before the official start of campaign and intend to keep running it up to a few days after the election.
